## Planning

- Simplify!

- Make mockups

### See photo over @ slack



## Modelling
- Pen and paper / Whiteboard
- Create models

USER model
------------------------------
  id    | name |    email    |
------------------------------
        |      |             |
------------------------------

EVENT model
------------------------------------------
id      | name |    user_id  |  event_id |
------------------------------------------
        |      |             |           |
------------------------------------------


ACTIVITY model
------------------------------
  id    | name |    city     |
------------------------------
        |      |             |
------------------------------



ASSIGNMENT: check whether there is a google map API for cities OR just make a CITY model

- Draw relationships
